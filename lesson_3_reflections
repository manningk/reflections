When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share work with others or have a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that you can control which changes are introduced.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks allow you to copy another repository on GitHub. Perhaps you don't have permission to change it. It is like a local clone, except for on GitHub servers.

Clones are a local copy of a local or rmote repository.

Branches are pointers to commits. They can be checked out like commits.
